# Module_20_challenge
My submission for the GWU FinTech bootcamp Module 20 challenge

For this project, I used Remix IDE and Solidity to create a simple safe-deposit contract which could be deposited and withdrawn from. 

Before the contract was deployed, I made sure that the code compiled correctly. 

I used Solidity version 5.0.0 for the project. 

I tested the deployed contract using Remix's built in user interface, which allowed me to verify that the code that I had written performed as expected.

The contract has three public functions and three public variables. 
Those functions are:
  -deposit
  -setAccounts
  -withdraw

Those variables are:
  -contractBalance
  -lastToWithdraw
  -lastWithdrawAmount
  
  Included below are screenshots of my interactions with the deployed contract:
